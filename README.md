This repository presents a Data Science task focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data visualization.

Key operations performed include:
Importing necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for data handling and visualization.
Utilizing head() to display the first 5 rows and tail() to show the last 5 rows of the dataset, providing an initial glimpse of the data.
Using shape to ascertain the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.
Determining the number of survivors and non-survivors by calculating the length (len()) of respective subsets.
Removing null values from the 'Age' column to ensure clean and complete data for analysis.

Generating visualizations:
Histogram (plt.hist()) to illustrate the distribution of ages among Titanic passengers.
Countplot (sns.countplot()) to visualize the distribution of passengers by sex.
Countplot (sns.countplot()) depicting the distribution of passengers across different passenger classes (Pclass).
